# about us

The *Binet Algorithmique et Data Science* (BADaS) is a student association at the [École polytechnique](https://polytechnique.edu/) focused on computer and data science.

Our goal is to promote computer and data science within the École polytechnique by

* setting up training sessions and signups to code and data science challenges,
* preparing students for *code interviews* with the assistance of both Computer Science Department professors and private companies,
* organising talks by experts in their field,
* performing *data science*, audit, consulting and research missions for companies or nonprofits,
* providing training data and calculation resources for students who require them,
* meeting with companies in order to open up on-site visits, partnerships for [Group Projects](https://www.polytechnique.edu/en/project-based-learning) or internships.
